# Performance Optimizations for Older Mobile Devices

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented in the TeeUp application to ensure smooth operation on older mobile devices.

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. Next.js Configuration (`next.config.ts`)
- **Image Optimization**: Configured modern image formats (WebP, AVIF) with fallbacks
- **Compression**: Enabled gzip compression for all assets
- **Caching Headers**: Set up aggressive caching for static assets
- **Optimized Bundle Size**: First load JS is ~101-114KB (excellent for mobile)

### 2. Dynamic Component Loading
- **Calendar Component**: Lazy loaded with dynamic imports to reduce initial bundle size
- **GolferModal Component**: Lazy loaded to improve first page load
- Both components have loading states and SSR disabled for better client performance

### 3. Vercel Configuration (`vercel.json`)
- **Edge Functions**: Converted API routes to Edge Runtime for faster response times
- **Security Headers**: Added security headers without performance impact
- **Asset Caching**: Configured long-term caching for JS and CSS files

### 4. Code Optimizations
- **Tree-shaking**: Already implemented - importing only specific functions from date-fns
- **Debounced Updates**: Signup changes are already debounced to reduce API calls

## Environment Configuration

Create a `.env.local` file with these optimized settings:

```env
# Database connection with pooling for better performance
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://[user]:[password]@[host]:[port]/[database]?pgbouncer=true&connection_limit=1"

# Optimize Prisma for production
PRISMA_ENGINE_TYPE="binary"
```

## Testing Performance

### Chrome DevTools Testing
1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Performance tab
3. Enable CPU throttling: "4x slowdown"
4. Set Network to "Slow 3G"
5. Run performance profiling

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**: Target < 2s
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: Target < 2.5s
- **Time to Interactive (TTI)**: Target < 3s
- **Total Bundle Size**: Monitor in build output

## Future Optimizations

Consider these additional optimizations if needed:
1. Enable PWA features (commented out in next.config.ts)
2. Implement service worker for offline support
3. Add resource hints (preconnect, prefetch)
4. Optimize fonts with `next/font`

## Deployment

After making these changes:
1. Commit and push to your repository
2. Vercel will automatically deploy with the new optimizations
3. Monitor performance using Vercel Analytics

The application should now perform significantly better on older mobile devices with slower processors and limited network connectivity.

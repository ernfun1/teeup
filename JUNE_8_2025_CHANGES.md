# June 8, 2025 Changes - TeeUp Golf Booking App

## Summary
Today we successfully implemented Calendar UI improvements following safe development practices. All changes were made on a feature branch (`safe-dev-setup`) and safely merged to main after testing.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Calendar Page Title Update
- **Changed**: "TeeUp Calendar" → "Calendar"
- **File**: `app/calendar/page.tsx`
- **Reason**: Cleaner, simpler UI

### 2. Removed Spot Counter Elements
- **Removed**: Circular badges showing "X spots" remaining
- **File**: `components/DayCard.tsx`
- **Visual Impact**: Cleaner day cards showing only date and golfer initials
- **Before**: Each day showed a colored badge (red for full, yellow for low spots, gray for available)
- **After**: Just the date header and golfer information

### 3. Removed Manual Refresh Button
- **Removed**: The "↻" refresh button next to navigation buttons
- **File**: `components/Calendar.tsx`
- **Note**: Automatic refresh (every 5 seconds) still active
- **Navigation**: Now shows only "Last Week" and "Next Week" buttons
